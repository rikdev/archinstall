# Arch install

It's just a compilation of the
"[Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide)"
to install Arch Linux on my desktops.

## Usage

Boot into the [Arch Linux ISO image](https://www.archlinux.org/download/),
then run `1_pre_installation` and follow the instructions.
